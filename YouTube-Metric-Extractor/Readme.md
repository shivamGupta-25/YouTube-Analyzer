YouTube Channel Analyzer

This tool analyzes YouTube channels and produces robust metrics and simple visualizations.

Key features:
- Computes uploads/week, shorts vs long distribution, runtimes, engagement, top titles/topics,
  6-month view/sub estimates, and quality/community/monetization heuristics.
- Tkinter GUI for input and CSV export
- Optional PNG visualizations saved to disk (requires `matplotlib`, install separately if needed)

Project structure
-----------------
- `main.py`: GUI entrypoint
- `youtube_edu_analyzer/`:
  - `config.py`: loads API key from `config/api_key.json` or `YT_API_KEY` env
  - `youtube_client.py`: YouTube Data API client wrapper
  - `analysis.py`: per-channel analysis and metric calculations
  - `insights.py`: aggregates insights across channels
  - `plots.py`: saves charts (not called by default)
- `config/api_key.json`: your key file (not committed)

API key
-------
- Put your key in `config/api_key.json` in this format:
  `{ "api_key": "YOUR_KEY" }`
- The app auto-loads it. You can still override in the GUI field.

Install
-------
- Python 3.9+
- Install deps:
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- To enable plots (optional):
  `pip install matplotlib`

Run
---
- `python main.py`

CSV export
----------
After analysis, you can export per-channel metrics to CSV via the GUI. Each row corresponds to a channel. Fields:

- `channel_id`: YouTube channel ID.
- `channel_title`: Channel display name.
- `subscribers`: Subscriber count at fetch time (may be null for hidden counts).
- `channel_total_views`: Lifetime channel views from the API.
- `sample_videos_analyzed`: Number of videos fetched and analyzed for this channel.
- `avg_uploads_per_week`: Average number of uploads per week across the analyzed span.
- `avg_uploads_long_per_week`: Average long-form (duration > 60s) uploads per week.
- `avg_uploads_shorts_per_week`: Average shorts (duration ≤ 60s) uploads per week.
- `avg_runtime_long_seconds`: Mean duration in seconds of long-form videos.
- `avg_runtime_shorts_seconds`: Mean duration in seconds of shorts.
- `engagement_pct_popular_videos`: Average engagement percentage among the top ~10% videos by views, computed as mean of (likes+comments)/views across those videos, expressed in percent. Videos with zero views are excluded from the per-video ratio.
- `top_5_long_titles`: JSON array of the top 5 long-form titles by views.
- `top_5_shorts_titles`: JSON array of the top 5 shorts titles by views.
- `cta_counts`: JSON object mapping detected call-to-action keywords (e.g., "subscribe", "join") to counts of descriptions containing them.
- `top_topics`: JSON array of the most frequent non-stopword tokens from video titles.
- `est_views_next_6_months`: Estimated total views over the next 26 weeks based on a clipped linear trend (fallbacks to recent-mean if needed).
- `est_subs_next_6_months`: Estimated new subscribers over the next 26 weeks using a conservative conversion multiplier.
- `quality_score_0_10`: Heuristic 0–10 score combining runtime norm, engagement, and topic diversity.
- `community_score_0_10`: Heuristic 0–10 score combining comments activity and community keyword presence.
- `monetization_inference`: Heuristic string describing monetization signals detected from descriptions.
- `avg_views_sample`: Mean views across the analyzed sample of videos.
- `engagement_rate_overall_pct`: Overall engagement rate across the sample, computed as (sum(likes)+sum(comments)) / sum(views) in percent.

Notes
-----
- Visualizations are generated by `youtube_edu_analyzer/plots.py` but are not triggered by default from the GUI.
- Be mindful of YouTube Data API v3 quotas.
